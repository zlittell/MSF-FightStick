# MSF-FightStick
Mechanical Squid Factory XInput PC Fight Stick

ATTENTION EVERYONE:
I would like to point you towards my new project:
https://github.com/zlittell/MSF-XINPUT

This is a library for teensyduino that allows you to create an XINPUT controller
The functionality is made easier to utilize for anyone making controllers.

I have reworked this fightstick code to actually make use of the library.
You will have to get the library and set it up first, similiar to how this project was originally done.

This is also included as an example in the library.
